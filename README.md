# Power-And-Gas-Corporate-Churn---Data-Science-Project
A major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small &amp; Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with us to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.


# Task 1 - Business Understading and Hypothesis Framing: 

- In order to test the hypothesis of whether churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivity, we
would need to model churn probabilities of customers, and derive the effect of prices on churn
rates. We would need the following data to be able to build the models.

Data needed:

1. Customer data - which should include characteristics of each client, for example,
industry, historical electricity consumption, date joined as customer etc.
2. Churn data - which should indicate if customer has churned.
3. Historical price data – which should indicate the prices the client charges to each
customer for both electricity and gas at granular time intervals.

Once we have the data, the work plan would be:

1. We would need to define what price sensitivity is and calculate it.
2. We would need to engineer features based on the data that we obtain, and build a
binary classification model (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted
Machines to name a few).
3. The best model would be picked based on the tradeoff between the complexity, the
explainability, and the accuracy of the models.
4. We would subsequently dive deeper into why and how price changes impact churn.
5. Last but not least, the model would allow us to size the business impact of the client’s
proposed discounting strategy
